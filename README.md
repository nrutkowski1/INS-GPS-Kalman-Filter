# INS-GPS-Kalman-Filter
Kalman Filter to determine GPS position and velocity, Euler Angles, from measured data.

Measured data includes GPS position, GPS velocity, Acceleration, Orientation, and Angular Velocity.

A Kalman Filter was developed to estimate orientation, position and velocity from the measured data. This was initially done with synthetic data and then was done using data collected from sensors.
